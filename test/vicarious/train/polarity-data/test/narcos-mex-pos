Love the second season.
The great production is you do not root for the main character.
Also loved seeing some of the actors of the 1st season.
I had already graduated high school when the murder of a DEA agent was killed.
The man made a great mistake because the Vice President had been the head of the CIA.
Yes the Gringos made the cartels pay for it. Hope another series will be in the works.
