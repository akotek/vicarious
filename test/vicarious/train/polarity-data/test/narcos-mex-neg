Yes, this is the worst, most uninteresting season, ever.
You know how conferences or shows these days must have 1 white guy, 2 African Americans, 2 Asians, one Indian guy and 4 females? That's what season 2 is to this show except it's for the worse.
Feels like female push to the big screen just for the sake of it, not a single female character is interesting, and they take like 50% of the time this season compared to the rest. Annoying girlfriends, attorneys, kingpins, all are females. The blandest lineup, ever. Same as Disney's push with Avengers.
I'll stick with El Chapo TV-Series and real facts, thank you very much.
