I've been told a thousand times so many reasons Whatever goes up must eventually fall down Don't go far because there's nothing to see there You wanted almost everything, to drink and also to eat Alone I'm small, with you I'm the biggest Everyone stares at me, I can do anything(=omnipotent) Everyone having fun tonight and don't forget to drink The square(=floor) is on fire, all the ladies are dancing Let's have fun what a great club* Dancing and forgetting, dancing and forgetting And when we entered the taxi we were a bit drunk You told me "pay, I don't have Shekels left" Don't go far, because I'm not a person that it's easy to forget Everyone having fun tonight and don't forget to drink The square(=floor) is on fire, all the ladies are dancing Let's have fun what a great club* Dancing and forgetting, dancing and forgetting Everyone having fun tonight and don't forget to drink The square(=floor) is on fire, all the ladies are dancing Let's have fun what a great club* Dancing and forgetting, Dancing, come on dance and forget
