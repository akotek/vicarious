I remember the time, the best time, when you used to say "I love you". How come the world stopped and everything disapreared and you said "baby" its over. I asked why, why are you leaving me in pain. I waited and waited and suddenly the tears came. It was really hard, and not nice of you to breake up with me in this situation. I dream of you, imagining you, every day, getting closer to me and looking at me and starts crying. I don't want to wake up, and go back to reality because reality is a nightmare. I await your latter, I wait and nothing arrives, can't find anything to calm me. How did you forget me, and stole my heart and five years with you, I threw to the trash. I can't relax, you just left and gave me the worst day, I waited and waited and the pain still bugs me. Look what you caused, you only made things worse and up to this day, you haven't paid the price. I dream of you, imagining you, every day, getting closer to me and looking at me and starts crying. I don't want to wake up, and go back to reality because reality is a nightmare.
