I think about the time How together with you I don’t care where Come here, let's live in a moshav And we’ll build us a small house Me and you I think about the future Ever since we met I knew it's with you for forever I won the lottery with you It’s impossible to lose it Me and you You're the kind That loves sky Advertising does not Reach your eyes Money comes and goes You say always You love me for real Not on stage In bed here with me I sing to you You clap my hands It only increases How as every day passes, I’m in love with you More and more I didn't say enough And time, no, it does not lie And I feel like shouting to you: You’re the whole world And at night When you're not with me How my heart Won't sleep On days When I fought alone You won them all With your quietness I think of paths How mine met with yours And we remained for years And thanks to the Creator That we remained sane Me and you I laugh because it's you You’re here You’re sitting in front of me And you don't know I'm writing you words That might turn into songs That will remain for years And you’re the type That loves eyes With your heart You'll fix the heavens Money comes and goes You always say You love me truly Not on stage In bed here with me I sing to you You clap my hands It only strengthens How as every day passes, I’m in love with you More and more I didn't say enough And time, no, it doesn't lie And I feel like shouting to you: You’re the whole world, And at night When you're not with me How my heart Doesn’t sleep During the days When we fought alone You won them all With your quietness
