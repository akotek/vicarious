I'm sitting on a boat Far away from you now, The sun warms the sea At the beach, the kids Are making a sand castle I want time to stop a bit for me I'm writing you about landscapes And I sing more songs to you, For there is no other girl like you My day is stormy Something's missing, I want to feel you in my blood If I won't get lost in the wind, If I won't walk a bit with myself, I won't find you Dancing next to me I want to fall in love I just want my heart To dance before you day and night Your beautiful eyes Are calling me over To spend the rest of my life with you Tonight there's a star Glowing upon me now Shines my way to you A dream coming true I am the dreamer Who dreams to meet only you tonight If I won't get lost in the windâ€¦
