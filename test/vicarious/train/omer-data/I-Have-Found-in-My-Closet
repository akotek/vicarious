I have found in my closet a harmonica and a piece of paper And I remembered some songs that I have long since forgotten About a balcony that someone had played on A flute for another loved one I have found in my closet Siddur and Tefillin And I remembered some prayers that I have long since forgotten About the scents of snuffs And about Zemirot of compassion I have found an old shirt and I remembered this pain Of a friend that I had, of a faded innocence And of a serenity that I have lost long ago, long ago I have found a drawing of a girl and I was flooded by memories Of simple dreams about the flight of a bird And of a thornbush that had left these scars of simplicity I have found in my closet a beret and a dog tag And I remembered the smell of the gunpowder That had burnt my innocence And made me forget how to be a child Then I've found an old shirt and I remembered this pain Of a friend that I had, of a faded innocence And of a serenity that I have lost long ago, long ago I have found a drawing of a girl and I was flooded by memories Of simple dreams about the flight of a bird And of a thornbush that had left these scars of simplicity I have found in my closet an old pair of shoes And I remembered these paths that I've walked on, all beautiful and well built Those shoes are like the roads I've walked on
