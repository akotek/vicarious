I've tried it all, wanted to get up and leave Don't care about all the ruckus around It's not like I've given up fast, you too are still fighting For some time now, the heart doesn't listen What happened to us all of a sudden, how you change every day right in front of me I remember us, two becoming one Time is not yet over, so don't let us say goodbye Get up, fight over me, now Look, it doesn't suit you being alone Like clear waters, it isn't hiding Tell me what goes on with you, I still remember We were complete, you loved a little more Now you're there alone, now you're there alone You've tried it all, to forcebly be happy It seems like there's nothing left to save True that we wanted more, you're not sorry for that It feels like the end has started long ago What happened to us all of a sudden, how you change every day right in front of me I remember us, two becoming one Time is not yet over, so don't let us say goodbye Get up, fight over me, now Look, it doesn't suit you being alone Like clear waters, it isn't hiding Tell me what goes on with you, I still remember We were complete, you loved a little more Now you're there alone, now you're there alone
