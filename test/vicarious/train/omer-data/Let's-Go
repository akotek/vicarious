Fire in the ground, my soul is heating up, When I see her I'm left without a breathe. What a girl, body dripping sweat, Getting crazy and dancing everyone's around her. Here I'm flying, what an insane beat, the dance floor is on fire and I'm burning. How beautiful she is, how she makes me crazy, And I'm being drawn toward her like a storm. What a party, so much love, Everyone's flying and everyone's beautiful. There isn't one who isn't dancing between Athens to Eilat. Fire in the ground, my soul is heating up, When I see her I'm left without a breathe. You came from the East, what an angel. All my friends you tossed aside.
