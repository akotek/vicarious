After all these years together I wanted to tell you I love you even more Then anything you can imagine You can see it in my eyes I love you too much From you I learned to stand strong and also to forgive what to insist on and what it makes sense to forget and even in the hardest times when I gave up you never gave up on me I look at you, at everything about you, you beat everything Suddenly it hits me that all I really have is you After all these years together I finally understand that you turned me into a better man And my heart appreciates you and you will be my only one and until the last of my days I will give you everything, I will give you everything After all these years together I can no longer forget I understand that I must not just hear, but also listen You are like a cool breeze on a hot day I swear to love you forever
