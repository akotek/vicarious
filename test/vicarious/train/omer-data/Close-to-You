You promised to return by the end of December I waited for you and once again you didn't come It rains heavily, autumn leaves are falling If only you knew what is love When you're far away from me Nothing seems right And when you touch, everything is different I want to be close to you I'm excited by the sight of your face I can't go on any longer without you How I love you so Only with you I feel different I smile when you laugh Because of you I bloom I never forget who you are to me Another year had passed with me believing That you'll return to be my only one We'll sit together and talk about a way Were we'll walk together to the end of the world Because when you're far away from me Nothing seems right And when you touch, everything is different I want to be close to youâ€¦
