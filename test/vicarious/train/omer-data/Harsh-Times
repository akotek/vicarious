The morning has found me exhausted From a long night of yearning The sun is up but the darkness remained For a week now, it doesn't leave me My lips are dry from calling your name And my head is heavy from thoughts How do I snap out of this and what about you Harsh times, harsh times We were drunk on young love We would fly with the wind Now I'm walking barefoot amongst the shards Can't find somewhere safe Perhaps the eyes spoke less We were together, but so alone Perhaps too rushed, was the one who whispered That we'll be better off separate We were drunk on young love We would fly with the wind Now I'm walking barefoot amongst the shards Can't find somewhere safe
