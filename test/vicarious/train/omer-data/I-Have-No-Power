In every corner of that house You've left nothing but lies, lies, lies Under the living room, on the couch, in the closet Trains move on and life flies along with them on the road, road, road I know I'll get over it eventually But now's not the time All these secrets, the cheatings with that guy Apparently everyone knew except for me You took lost years away from me And now you're alone 'cause you loved only me You're standing there crying at my doorstep Saying, "Everyone makes mistakes" with sincere eyes, with sincere eyes I have no power to forgive you, to let go, to pardon To forget it all I want to, but I just can't I don't know what to do anymore How picture you in the darkness with him My heart is almost out of its mind Out of its mind In every alley of the street of that house Memories arise, arise, arise And how we kissed in the rain back then We never cared about life And I have thoughts in my mind, just wanting to tell you words, words, words Maybe it's better for me to shut up, I think When the truth is in your face All the passions that you rushed to fulfill Like a crazy girl in strangers' fields You took lost years away from me And now you're alone 'cause you loved only me You're standing there crying at my doorstep Saying, "Everyone makes mistakes" with sincere eyes, with sincere eyes I have no power to forgive you, to let go, to pardon To forget it all I want to, but I just can't Yeah, I don't know what to do anymore How picture you in the darkness with him My heart is almost out of its mind Out of its mind I have no power to forgive you, to let go, to pardon To forget it all I want to, but I just can't I don't know what to do anymore How picture you in the darkness with him My heart is almost out of its mind So don't be mad 'cause it's all your fault And it would never work out again between us You took a piece of my soul all to yourself All to yourself
