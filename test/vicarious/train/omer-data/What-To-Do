Why does it happen this way, I can never get out of it I'm sitting thinking what to do and I find no answers Everyone's trying to explain the situation But deep down I know it doesn't count I want to stop it all, I want to but I can't I don't know how it all happened so fast without warning So what to do? What to do, I ask myself each night Will she return or never come back again? That beautiful time of peace and serenity Is over, but I still have hope in me How beautiful it all was, calm and different Suddenly it's all strange, I keep thinking of tomorrow I hope I will be alright deep within When I'm alone with myself and not just with friends So what to do? What to do, I ask myself each night Will she return or never come back again? That beautiful time of peace and serenity Is over, but I still have hope in me Wherever I go, I can't find anything exciting I have this feeling of scorching sadness inside I walk around the street, can't understand what everybody wants And once again I'm all alone with those moments
