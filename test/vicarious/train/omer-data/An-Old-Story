An old story, a small town beyond the sea She was alone and radiant Far from here We wrote our names in blood In a youthful promise you remember We kissed softly, smeared in naivete We hugged every day, moments of simplicity The sun only shone onto us more We swore forever to stay always The summer ends and how shall I return home I'm writing to you My love with pretty eyes, I write for now You're the fire, I'm the water, a bird with no wings Only dream of you every night, my far girl I'm always yours And how the time deludes, hits the heart like an arrow It crawls and drives, for sure doesn't know That the longing goes up in flames when the soul is sad At the end of a rainy season I'll return to you I'm writing to you An old story on a letter that's beyond the sea You wrote that you can't get by So far, don't be angry I hope you'll forgive This faraway love hurts me And how the longing drives the imagination nuts Understand my love there is no sense here Two kids in the whole wide world And one summer screams to me The heart burns, I'm writing a letter to you But I'm not sending it My love with pretty eyes I write for now You're the fire, I'm the water, a bird with no wings Only dream of you every night, my far girl I'm always yours And how the time deludes, hits the heart like an arrow It crawls and drives, for sure doesn't know That the longing goes up in flames when the soul is sad An old story, a dream of summer, I miss you
