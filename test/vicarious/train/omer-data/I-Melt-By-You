You've said you love Living as if we're in a movie, With violins and roses. You've said you're giving me, Saving your heart for me, And that you've waited years for me. The soul is there in kisses, Which only to you I give. There isn't any other one, I love, I love you. I love you up to the clouds, And I'm in love with you, in love with your eyes. A fire inside of me, I'm melting by you. Give me a love which is burning, I don't have any other one There's a fire inside of me, I melt by you. The love is igniting, When you're me embracing (me) in your two beautiful arms. Always, I will be for you Always I will give you My whole heart, I promise. The soul is there in kisses, Which only to you I give. There isn't any other one, I love, I love you. I love you up to the clouds, And I'm in love with you, in love with your eyes. A fire inside of me, I'm melting by you. Give me a love which is burning, I don't have any other one There's a fire inside of me, I melt by you. I want to sing to you here, in front of the moon I wish to pluck a shining star with you. The soul is there in kisses, Which only to you I give. There isn't any other one, I love, I love you. I love you up to the clouds, And I'm in love with you, in love with your eyes. A fire inside of me, I'm melting by you. Give me a love which is burning, I don't have any other one There's a fire inside of me, I melt by you.
