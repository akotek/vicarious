I found myself thinking of you Out of nowhere Who are you moving on with How are your days passing, your nights so far Did your dream come true Have you found yourself some peace Nothing is simple with me anymore I raise my hands up a bit more Hoping that the light will turn on within me That the days will pass and the sky will open up A day passes, I'm not giving up I sing to you I repeat and say once more That it's not too late Don't let me fall The night falls over the city I think about you some more About all we could've been How come another day passes, ends I'm still singing to you Looking for solutions once again Looking for solutions A day passes, I'm not giving up I sing to you I repeat and say once more That it's not too late Don't let me fall So a day passes, I'm not giving up I sing to you I repeat and say once more That it's not too late Don't let me fall
