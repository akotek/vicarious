Tell me what's new
My heart is weak
How I dream
Of beauty like this
And there's no fear inside me
If you're a trap, honey
I already don't care
About drowning in the river
And you walk down the street with a dress
And around you, the whole city's already bustling
True, not all that glitters is gold
But it seems to me that I'm in love
Just don't break my heart
Because I counted on you, I counted on you
Before I met you
I'd already dreamt of you, I'd dreamt of you
Tell me for how long
Your father's been a gardener
How I dream
Of a flower like this
I'm walking on a tightrope
My heart is cracked
I already don't care
About jumping from the mountaintop
And on Jaffa nights there's a party
And you dance in the middle of the square
True, not all that glitters is gold
But it seems to me that I'm in love
Just don't break my heart
Because I counted on you, I counted on you
Before I met you
I'd already dreamt of you, I'd dreamt of you
Just don't break my heart
Because I counted on you, I counted on you
Before I met you
I'd already dreamt of you, I'd dreamt of you
