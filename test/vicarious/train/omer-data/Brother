We were both born into the same world, one of warmth and love - a perfect world. I remember how we'd play all evening, a table turned into a fort and a broom to a sword. Now I'm missing you but I don't say. And what we even argued about i don't remember anymore. Back then we used to help each other overcome, so lets try to overcome and talk about it, what do you say? Brother - come and lets be happy, Brother - lets forget the argument, Brother - call me brother, Brother - I'll always forgive you. We'll go back home united, in the background of glory sings one, together we won't be alone, forever. We both have the same hair, same crooked smile, same honest character. So lets stop the arguments, I want to see you, on holidays, events, and Shabbats, to live my life alongside you. Within my heart, my memories, my soul, you'll always be with me, you're mine. Brother - come and lets be happy, Brother - lets forget the argument, Brother - call me brother, Brother - I'll always forgive you. We'll go back home united, in the background of glory sings one, together we won't be alone, forever.
