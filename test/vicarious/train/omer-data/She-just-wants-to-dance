We have no time, black or white, "Change your attitude" she says. "We shall chase, a crazy rhythm" The way she see life is a little different. No need for a wedding, no white dress, It's a waste of money for her. With all the respect, and she has respect – All she wanna do is dance. Nothing you can do about it She just wants to dance. Wherever you take her She just wants to dance. From Mykonos beach to Mosh's beach, Climb on the bar, don’t think of tomorrow She only wants to dance. Get a loan, buy her a house - It's not interesting she says. Routine is passe; so don’t even try To be like everyone else, cause she's different. It’s a one in a lifetime thing, we only live once - It’s a unique opportunity my dear. Give her a respect, she cracked the code She just wants to dance. Nothing you can do about it - She just wants to dance. Wherever you take her She just wants to dance. From Mykonos beach to Mosh's beach, Climb on the bar, don’t think of tomorrow She only wants to dance. And it makes her sexy Makes her pretty She closes her eyes And dances barefoot.
