Only to you, only to you How much I sang only to you On those nights where I couldn't find any light Only to you, only to you I always sing only to you I will always remember your voice What of me, what of me What happened to me? This is how it feels to fall in love Who's calling for me?

This is how it feels to fall in love Who's calling for me? Perhaps she'll answer me Like this, when your heart is suddenly pounding Like this, when your heart is suddenly pounding Like this, when your heart is suddenly pounding
