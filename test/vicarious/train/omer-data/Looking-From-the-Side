I'm looking from the side, cigarette in hand In this full-of-lies city, all alone, almost losing my mind So many masks, cowards in disguises And how can I find you among all this mess, it's worth a shot The sun goes down, another day ended Even though the fog doesn't leave a scar, it still hurts I want to devour the night, to make you a dream And then I'll be able to breathe I always dream of you smiling In an apologizing laughter, dry lips thirsty for love The type of girl that's never shy Proud, calm, good for love With a mouth nude of kisses, I breathe you from afar Oh my love, my love And I'm looking through the darkness and my soul is pretty miserable, miserable For me and for her So I look from the side, broken from all the loneliness In a city that never sleeps, almost losing my mind Where did all the innocence go, waves of uncertainty I'm almost trapped between imagination and reality The sun is rising, another day begins Maybe I'll find you today, I always knew how to dream I want to devour the morning, to find me a place And then I'll be able to breathe The sun goes down Even though the fog doesn't leave a scar, it still hurts I want to devour the night And then I'll be able to breathe
