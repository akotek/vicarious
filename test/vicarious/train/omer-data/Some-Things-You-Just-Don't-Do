You don't eat before washing your hands You don't enter The Dead Sea after shaving your legs1 You don't peel a clementine2 in a room full of people Some things you just don't do, some things you just don't! You don't shower without using water I won't forget thee, O Jerusalem You don't skip the optometrist before buying glasses Some things you just don't do, some things you just don't! I've been looking for something fitting Fitting my face Something nice You must always respect your eyes So I bought some glasses to see brighter I saw with my own eyes what makes us dance Let's raise a toast, we can see the distance 'Cause in this life, there are just things you don't do With an optometrist Here in the Middle East You'll have a prefect vision In the end, you'll see the road I bought a pair of glasses It isn't such a big deal Feels bad for your eyes So give them some respect You don't threaten a pigeon with wine3 You don't wear sandals with socks You don't post pictures of people eating Some things you just don't do, some things you just don't!
