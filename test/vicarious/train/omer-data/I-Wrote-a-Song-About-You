We haven't talked for a week, And I have no power to get up anymore. What have you done to me, my beautiful one? You light up the universe for me. Without you, I am not me. There's no one to laugh with at night anymore. So, I wrote a song about you- Simple songs with the guitar. So, come to me tonight! We'll hug and and be excited together. And I'll make you feel Like the most, most, most special one. Maybe you'll come to me for a moment, I cooked something delicious [for you]. We'll put on songs you love, And we'll dance like kids. So, what are we going now? Tell me. There is a cure for a broken heart. Come, let's run away from here now. Maybe another chance is being given. And we'll sit there on the porch. We'll open our hearts and talk frankly. And slowly, slowly and quietly, I'll reveal secrets to you. So, come to me tonight! We'll hug and and be excited together. And I'll make you feel Like the most, most, most special one. Maybe you'll come to me for a moment, I cooked something delicious [for you]. We'll put on songs you love, And we'll dance like kids.
