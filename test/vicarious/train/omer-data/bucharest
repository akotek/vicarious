Sitting here by myself, a little bit bored
Suddenly the phone's ringing is heard
It's a once single friend, he's getting married
Reminding me - in the weekend, don't forget it
Talked with the Marriot - everything is ticketed
On our way to Romania, excitement is the only thing i feel
And if you're mad at me, it's not a big deal
He is not a friend, he's my brother, so I have no choice
Bucharest
Its the time of your life
Getting lost in ourselves
The excitement is overflowing my mind
I never forget you
Everything's is blurred
Tonight there isn't anybody happier than me
Always surrounded by at least five friends
On my way to a long convoy of trains
Today we will make all the Romanians happy
And here all the bottle is emptied in a snap
In Bucharest, habibi*, life is crazy
Bucharest
Its the time of your life
Getting lost in ourselves
The excitement is overflowing my mind
I never forget you
Everything's is blurred
The weekend is over, everyone is grumpy again
On our way back everybody's daydreaming
But it's not so bad, there is something comforting
At the end of the month, Achidov's brother is getting married
