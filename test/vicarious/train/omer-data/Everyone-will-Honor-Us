[Verse 1] Sitting with her like a macho on the bar, bar, bar Feeling like some Pablo Escobar, bar, bar What you do, it suits me right Giving her a 'Douze Points', make her feel good [Bridge 1] Say the name, I can't breathe Say "Je t’aime", or something like that No problem for me to give you whatever you want for now I'll take another peek at your eyes, what's wrong with that? Mirror, mirror on the wall Tell her she's the fairest of them all1 [Chorus] Party all night long, everyone's crazy about me and her Give it up for her , give it up for me So let's break the glass2 and go out dancing in the streets That is all, and everyone will honor us Hello hello, police! There's a robbery here tonight I'm stealing her heart, somebody stop me And if it ends well, then let's all go out dancing in the streets That is all, that is all, what more did I ask? [Verse 2] So I'm talking to her about crap and nonsense She's drinking and suddenly says to me in Russian, "Да, да, да!3" So what are you having? It suits me right Tomorrow will be here soon, come on, quit your thinking [Bridge 2] Say the name, I can't breathe anymore Say "Je t’aime", 'cause I want you to I wanna clear up my mind with you for like two days To feel like a child, what's wrong with that? Mirror, mirror on the wall Tell her she's the fairest of them all4 [Chorus] Party all night long, everyone here's crazy about me and her Give it up for her , give it up for me So let's break the glass and go out dancing in the streets That is all, and everyone will honor us Hello hello, police!
