How you say, the time has passed The time of the talk about our relationship Where are you going? You keep yourself in my life I'm tired of you to no end How many tears And logic plays with the imagination again And for a moment I'm omnipotent Can overcome myself Enough, still it's over Don't come back to me, Love, how are you not ashamed? I look for myself, living within a dream So figure this out yourself, you're not always right I can't find myself, only at the end of the day Only at the end of the day I come to you, throw away my tie It's hard for me to breathe anyway At the end of the day to you, only to you, your eyes make me return Money that comes and goes as usual You work exactly until midnight And then you cry On me, that you've left there on the side Love or money, it's hard for you to choose How many tears And again logic games in the living room That only your mother understands I'm just one man, one in a million Don't come back to me, Love, how are you not ashamed? I look for myself, living within a dream So figure this out yourself, you're not always right I can't find myself, only at the end of the day Only at the end of the day I come to you, throw away my tie It's hard for me to breathe anyway At the end of the day to you, only to you, your eyes make me return Don't come back to me, Love, how are you not ashamed? I look for myself, living within a dream Don't come back to me, Love, you're not always right I can't find myself, only at the end of the day At the end of the day I come to you, throw away my tie It's hard for me to breathe anyway At the end of the day I come to you, leaving the party I drank two days ago anyway At the end of the day to you, only to you, your eyes make me return
