Day After Day, years passing Running without rest White Nights gray days Trying not to shed tears As a smokescreen I did not notice And feeling blur Where vogue again How long suffering Still waiting, might you come back Almost no strength left in me Waiting might you come back to me The heart has not learned to forget And again sinking in the gathered memories This is all that's left Day After Day and how many lies When I find a shady corner Dark rises, sad songs When you will open the door
