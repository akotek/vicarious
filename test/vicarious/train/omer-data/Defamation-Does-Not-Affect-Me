I hate all the yelling, all the shit that goes on on the roads I hate that every answer became "That's life." Don't know anymore, I'm a little involved with myself I hate fake people and there are always tons of them Could you stop? How come they're never sick of opening drawers1? I can hear, I swear, I can hear everything And without falling, I'm not afraid, now that I'm used to being alone I can do this, just don't take my night away Defamation2 does not affect me Be simple, can't you just be happy? Forget all the nonsense, just love yourself always And even if it's hard, and sometimes slips away Keep meaning it, in the end you will win Don't worry, hear me out, don't worry, man I hate how everyone pretends to be a family3 And how can you stay sane when everyone's smoking? I don't know, maybe better off not asking I hate bad habits, food that comes in boxes Every day I learn to live in a country of news I can hear, I can hear, hear everything And without falling, I'm not afraid, now that I'm used to being alone I can do this, just don't take my night away Defamation does not affect me Be simple, can't you just be happy? Forget all the nonsense, just love yourself always And even if it's hard, and sometimes slips away Keep meaning it, in the end you will win Don't worry, hear me out, don't worry, man I hate reading lies about what I'll be doing tomorrow I hate all that's happened many years ago at the square I don't know, can't find myself anymore I hate costumes and labels, and there's a sea-ful4 of them, it's hard to swim I don't get people who can't learn from their mistakes I'm drowning, and only I can save myself Defamation does not affect me Be simple, can't you just be happy? Forget all the nonsense, just love yourself always And even if it's hard, and sometimes slips away too Keep meaning it, 'cause in the end you will win Don't worry, hear me out, don't worry, man
