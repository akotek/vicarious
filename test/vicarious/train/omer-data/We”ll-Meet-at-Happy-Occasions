Again you’re lecturing me On what’s right and not right It’s a little hard on me I’m losing sleep From here to there and back I search for understanding A quiet game of touring in imagination Hello drama queen Another show for the day You opened yourself a theater in the living room And you’re making me problems In the end there will be tears here So sweety I’ve got news Who are you calling crazy Who are you calling crazy You flipped the fault onto me Someone else will get hurt Its coming to me spontaneously See what you’re doing to me It disgusts me to play the whose stronger games We”ll meet just at happy occasions What did I already do wrong here and there You still want go back After each comeback You dig another pit On a thin sting we walk slow And you’re great at the game And like always you leave me in the dust Hello drama queen Another show for the day You opened yourself a theater in the living room And you’re making me problems In the end there will be tears here So sweety I’ve got news Who are you calling crazy Who are you calling crazy You flipped the fault onto me Someone else will get hurt Its coming to me spontaneously See what you’re doing to me It disgusts me to play the whose stronger games We”ll meet just at happy occasions Your theater abilities are top And I don’t have time for games You obsess over what we do You bite off my head I just eat movies It’s always a hilly train ride with you Ups and downs It makes me bust inside So... Who are you calling crazy Who are you calling crazy You flipped the fault onto me Someone else will get hurt Its coming to me spontaneously See what you’re doing to me It disgusts me to play the whose stronger games We”ll meet just at happy occasions
