Like always, you set up businesses (submerge yourself in work) Like, everything's bright (everything's fine) But inside you you know that it's not enough Withdrawn, all alone the whole night You wait for the one to come that will take you far from here to a new destination Don't look, him will come don't worry, he's already here If you open your heart, in the end, everything will change You draw your daydreams If anything, your dreams will pass But immediately, the returning reality shows that everything was just an illusion You're afraid of the changing times, you wrap (shield) your face from the cold And again, you return to bed cold and lonely
