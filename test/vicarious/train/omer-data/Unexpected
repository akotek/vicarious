I asked if we could at least sit and talk about it To understand what happened and if we can fix it You just walked away without a word How you left everything and left me no choice I want to fix this, so we can go back to our nest I'm willing to try if you'd agree to rebuild this So we'd love like old times and forget about all the anger Start anew and love with no fear I love you, just open up your heart I'm so sorry, I can't sleep at night It was unexpected, just give me a chance To get close to you again, to look into your eyes In a sea of mistakes I swam with you I did stupid things, it's also a bit because of you I don't look for reasons, I just want to hope That you'll remove any pain and truly forgive from your heart I love you, just open up your heart I'm so sorry, I can't sleep at night It was unexpected, just give me a chance To get close to you again and to look into your eyes It was unexpected, just give me a chance To get close to you again, to look into your eyes I love you, just open up your heart I'm so sorry, I can't sleep at night It was unexpected, just give me a chance To get close to you again, to look into your eyes I love only you, I'll forgive you for everything I miss looking into your eyes so much
