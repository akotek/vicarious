There's no love as strong as mine, You can look but you'll never find, You know. I'm savoring your beauty, I look forward for tomorrow every day. Just know that without you I, I have nothing. 'Cause there's no other, 'Cause there's no one else but you, Give me an eternity next to you. 'Cause there's no other, What wouldn't I give you of me? It is you who bought my world. You make my heart skip a beat And you love with all your soul. You hear me? Without you I won't last for even a minute. You will forever reside in my soul, you are the one. 'Cause there's no other, 'Cause there's no one else but you, Give me an eternity next to you. 'Cause there's no other, What wouldn't I give you of me? 'Cause there's no other, 'Cause there's no one else but you, Give me an eternity next to you. 'Cause there's no other, What wouldn't I give you of me? It is you who bought my world.
