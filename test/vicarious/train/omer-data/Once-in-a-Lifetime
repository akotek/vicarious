I call you this way Special this way You blow me far away Into another magical moment out there at the edge of the universe You light a fire inside me that I do not know Maybe I'll take you to a picnic And we'll have a drink, you'll speak Yiddish And suddenly you'll smile at me So life had turned me crazy over you If you're gone, you know I'm a goner That's how it is when all is too good… It comes in waves and you are quiet like the sea And at night you're like a storm when you laugh If I had any words I would've told the whole world a long time ago How good I feel when I'm alone with you So till morning, till morning Dancing with you, loving you without a stopwatch All the way with you forever Such joy, how much joy Waking up with you every day, every morning A love of once in a lifetime So I don't have what to say You are beautiful as always Like an old dream coming true And speaking of which I would push mountains For you till you see the sun breaking Let's take two days for ourselves You and me – Jerusalem For all you know I might pull out a ring If I forget you, you know… Life had turned me crazy over you If you're gone, you know I'm a goner (I'm a goner) It comes in waves and you are quiet like the sea And at night you're like a storm when you laugh If I had any words I would've told the whole world a long time ago How good I feel when I'm alone with you Till morning, till morning Dancing with you, loving you without a stopwatch All the way with you forever Such joy, how much joy Waking up with you every day, every morning A love of once in a lifetime
