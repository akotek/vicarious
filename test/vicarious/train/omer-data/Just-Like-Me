I don't understand your games For a moment there you tell me Come to me, come to me And suddenly your gaze turnes empty Stepping back, coming closer Come to me, come to me You're scared that this might be real At least that's how it seems You're surely in love Come to me, come to me And it's absurd that you're just like me I swear there's barley any difference I'm similar to you, I swear, my footsteps will testify it When will you tell me "I love you" When will I tell you "I love you" When will we stop this game Only God knows I don't know all your gazes What do you mean Come to me, come to me And suddenly without even saying goodbye You walk away, you're coming back Come to me, come to me You know that it's real now At least that's how it seems I love you now that you're with me Come to me, come to me
