They say, two years from now all the melodies will end and I'll have nothing to sing to you in some sad moment it's like a "Déjà vu" come closer now tight, tight they say that the sky will peel soon and god will save us from all the madness. so what are you afraid from? what are you afraid from? in the end, everything passes I remember I was hurt once my heart was broken by someone I loved so much all the moments I was happy in them came to their end in a second came to their end in a second and soldiers come back home from their officer to a crazy weekend maybe to a lonely island there are people who only engage in being scared all their life you are rolling to yourself a cigarette and say that... through red eyes, we can see more beautiful look, in the end every color peels I think... in the end, everything passes I remember I was hurt once my heart was broken by someone I loved so much all the moments I was happy in them came to their end in a second came to their end in a second so in the end, everything passes I remember I was hurt once my heart was broken by someone I loved so much all the moments I was happy in them came to their end in a second came to their end in a second in the end, everything passes that's what my mother have told me time is flying by like airplanes in the sky everything passes in the end many people I used to know they won't come back they won't come back
