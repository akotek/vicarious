She is compassion on nights of sorrow In the days, she will open the gate for me In a long, caressing silence1 She is there, soon to leave For years I am singing to her Sending flowers, and she cannot get enough For days I am waiting for her She is leaving, I'm losing my mind You left, my heart broke again You burned all that I had The laughter rolls out, so does the sadness This song is all I have left Have mercy on me and give me Love, never leave me I wander at night before the moon Calling out, she doesn't answer, and I'm screaming She is loneliness, she is the shining light And I drink, can never forget Dancing all crazy before the moon Disappearing from everyone, running away No one understands what happened to me How in a moment I suddenly vanished They say I'm losing my mind Wandering the streets, calling her name Have mercy on me and give me Love, never leave me I wander at night before the moon Calling out, she doesn't answer, and I'm screaming Have mercy on me and give me Love, never leave me I wander at night before the moon Calling out, she doesn't answer, and I'm screaming You left, my heart broke again You burned all that I had The laughter rolls out, so does the sadness This song is all I have left
